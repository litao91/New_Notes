# Convergence of Random Variable

Two main idea:

* The **law of large numbers**: Sample average converges in probability to expectation. 
* The **central limit theorem**: $$\sqrt{n}(\overline{X}_n - \mu)$$ **converges in distribution** to a Normal distribution. => Sample average has approximately a Normal distribution for large $$n$$.
